# programming practice
This is a record of my programming practice.  
These practice questions can be provided for beginners in programming to use and practice with.My solution is not the best solution though, it is correct due to the face that every question is tested by OJ system. You can run my code as an OJ system to calculate result to Check if your code is correct.



**tips: Every code was written by C++ language, and the C++ version should be laster than C++11.**
